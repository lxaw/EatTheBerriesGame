## :cinema: Video:

## :grey_question: What is it?
* Relatively simple JavaScript game using ES6 classes.
* Prior to ES6, classes were kinda haphahazard, either being functions that act like classes or someother construction.
* Onto the game.
* Responsive, plays sounds, has an intro and ending, score, etc.
* See video!

## :zap: Features:
* Intro screen!
* End screen w/ stats from in-game!
* Music, sounds! Colors! Berries!
* Collision, inheritance, multiple inheritance, oh my!

###### :hammer: To do:
* Clean it up. Especially the start and end game buttons (I believe some stuff there is redundant). 

###### :thought_balloon: What was learned:
* JavaScript - learned much more than I knew prior, especially with using classes (prior to that I was using functions that acted as classes). Furthermore, scoping with regards to eventListeners and the power of arrow functions was also made known. Good stuff!

###### :seedling: Ideas for Improvement:
* Clean it up! Make a leaderboard!
